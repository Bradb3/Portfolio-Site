              <p>My name is Brad and I am a Software Developer living in St. Petersburg, FL.  I recently graduated from the University of South Florida where, I studied Information Technology.</p><p>I discovered my love of computers and programming in middle school by programming batch files to prank my friends.  Once I entered high school, I began developing websites for fun and first learned HTML and CSS.  When I was a sophomore in high school; I learned about Bitcoin and, bought some of the first USB ASIC miners on the market.  I learned enough Linux to run the miners with a Raspberry Pi, and I mined Bitcoin for six months.  I joined the Robotics club in my junior and senor years where, I was first exposed to C++.  Once I graduated high school; I enrolled in university, and began to take my resale business seriously.  I flipped everything I could find (600+ distinct items) with a 100% customer satisfaction rate, and im still looking whenever I get a chance!</p><p>In University; the first language I learned was Python, and it remains one of my favorite languages.  I then learned Java which I also enjoyed.  When I took web development; I learned about Javascript, and Bootstrap and relearned HTML, and CSS. When I took databases, I was introduced to SQL which is one of my favorite languages.  In my final semester, I learned C# and PHP which added to my interest in software development.</p><p>In my free time, I love to be outdoors.  My biggest passion is SCUBA diving having been certified for over 12 years.  There is nothing short of floating like an astronaut that can compare to being in deep clear water.  My favorite dive was on the wreck of the USNS Vandenberg in Key West, seeing the 500 foot ship slowly fade into view on descent was breathtaking.  I also like fishing, backpacking, and longboarding.</p><p>This is my personal portfolio website that I plan on maintaining throughout my career.  </p><p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
